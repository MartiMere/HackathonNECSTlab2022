# HackathonNECSTlab2022
Project for "Hackathon 2021/2022" by Politecnico di Milano - NECSTlab

## Introduction
What if you are the boss of a company working from home and you want to attend a meeting but you can not talk face to face to your employees that are in the conference room? What if you are in a zoom meeting from home and you can not see the person talking because the camera is stucked in a single position? What if you are a professor supervising exams in a big classroom and you can not make everyone quiet at the same time without bothering the class? Well, I can give you the solution in a few simple steps. This project is interesting to make, to explore the Arduino world and the endless possibilities it gives you thanks to the noumerous attachments you can use with it, in this case we are talking about sound sensors. In particular five sound sensors register the intensity of the sorrounding sound and the one whose value is the highest is the sensor in which position the servo motor will rotate. In addiction, five leds connected to the sensors will turn on depending on which sensor relevates the highest volume to ensure its funcionality. Servo motor is positioned in such a way that you can put a base on it and fix them togheter, making a rotating base, on which it is possible to put a camera, a display or whatever it is needed for the purpose you have in your mind. 

## Base and Structure
First of all the structure on which the sensors will be located needs to be functional to the disposition of the Arduino UNO board, the breadboards and cables, so it is a good way to simplify things to choose a 180 degrees disposition instead of a 360 degrees disposition. It allowes a quick check of the components through the back part of the structure and it is easier to assemble and to carry arround. As it comes to materials, cardboard and hot glue are the best to minimize the weight and making it easier to put together.
